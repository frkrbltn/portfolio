# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### TODO

- Create the publication and Resume page in figma.
- If you do not want to open a tab or a new page for resume, explain what to do in figma instead of designing
  Because we have a tap for Resume, when user clicks on it, it will display an empty page and open a new tag on the browser.
  So explain what to do for Resume.
